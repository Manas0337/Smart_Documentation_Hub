the solution 1 folder contain Front_end folder which is for frontend and Smart Documentation Hub folder is for backend and give database script in mongodb 

create database according to the requirements then create backend according to the requirements and database and then create integrated frontend according to backend


TECH STACK
- Frontend: React + Vite (JavaScript), React Router, Axios, Bootstrap 5 (responsive, modern UI)
- Backend: ASP.NET Core Web API (.NET 8 preferred), clean architecture style (Controllers -> Services -> Repositories)
- Database: MongoDB (MongoDB.Driver)
- Auth: JWT access token + refresh token support
- Email OTP: OTP verification for new account email + OTP for password reset (send OTP to email)
- Environment variables: use .env for frontend and appsettings.json + user secrets for backend

CORE REQUIREMENTS (MUST IMPLEMENT)
1) AUTH FLOWS (UI + API + DB)
A. Create Account / Signup Page fields:
- fullName
- username (unique)
- email (unique)
- mobileNo
- password (hash it)
- dateOfBirth
- After signup: send OTP to email for verification.
- User is created as emailVerified=false until OTP verified.
- UI: show success/error toasts (NOT alert), loader, field validation.
- OTP UI: input box + resend OTP with timer + verify button.

B. Login Page:
- allow login with either (username OR email) + password
- return JWT access token + refresh token
- store tokens securely (access token in memory or localStorage; refresh token in httpOnly cookie if possible; if not, document approach)
- UI: show errors clearly (invalid creds, not verified email, etc.)

C. Forgot Password Page:
- input: email
- send OTP to email
- UI: success toast “OTP sent”

D. Change/Reset Password Page:
- fields: email + otp + newPassword
- verify OTP then update password (hashed)
- UI: success toast and redirect to login

E. Logout:
- clear tokens; invalidate refresh token server-side.

2) DASHBOARD AFTER LOGIN (Protected Routes)
Dashboard must have:
A. Profile Page
- show user info (fullName, username, email, mobile, DOB, verified)
- allow user to edit profile fields (except email/username)
- API + UI validation

B. Upload Document Page
- allow upload: pdf, txt, doc/docx, jpg, jpeg, png, image files
- store file in backend (choose one approach and implement fully):
  Option 1: store in local “Uploads/” folder + store metadata in MongoDB
  Option 2: store file as GridFS + store metadata
- Save metadata: ownerId, originalFileName, storedFileName/fileId, fileType, size, uploadDate
- After upload show confirmation message (toast)
- show list of uploaded docs (table/cards) with:
  - file name
  - type
  - upload time
  - actions: View / Download / Delete

C. View Uploaded Document inside Dashboard:
- PDF preview (iframe/pdf viewer)
- Images preview
- txt preview (render content)
- doc/docx: allow download + (optional preview if easy)

3) BASIC EDITING (MINIMUM FACILITY)
Implement minimal editing for:
- text files: open editor with textarea, update content, save -> backend updates stored file
- Also provide “Notes” editor for any document: store a separate editable text content per document (like description/summary) in MongoDB.
- Include versioning baseline: every save creates a new version record in MongoDB (versionNumber, editedBy, timestamp, content or diff).
Keep it simple but working.

4) SECURITY + QUALITY
- Password hashing: BCrypt
- Validation: backend DTO validation + frontend validation
- Protect routes with JWT (Authorize attribute)
- Role not required (optional)
- Proper error handling, consistent API responses
- CORS configured for Vite dev server
- Swagger enabled
- Logging for important events

PROJECT STRUCTURE (MUST DELIVER)
- Provide full folder structure for:
  /backend/SmartDocumentHub.Api
  /backend/SmartDocumentHub.Core
  /backend/SmartDocumentHub.Infrastructure
  /frontend/smart-doc-hub-ui
- Provide complete code for:
  Backend: Program.cs, appsettings, controllers, models, DTOs, services, Mongo repositories, JWT utilities, email service, OTP logic, refresh token logic, file upload endpoints, file view endpoints, text edit endpoints, version model.
  Frontend: Vite setup, routing, pages (Signup + OTP Verify, Login, Forgot Password, Reset Password, Dashboard, Profile, Upload, Document Viewer, Text Editor/Notes), Axios interceptor for JWT, protected route component, Bootstrap UI, toast notifications.

DATABASE DESIGN (MONGODB COLLECTIONS)
- users: { _id, fullName, username, email, mobileNo, passwordHash, dateOfBirth, emailVerified, createdAt, refreshTokens[] }
- otps: { _id, email, codeHash, purpose (verifyEmail/resetPassword), expiresAt, attempts, createdAt }
- documents: { _id, ownerId, fileName, fileType, size, storageId/path, uploadedAt, notes, currentVersion }
- documentVersions: { _id, documentId, versionNumber, content, editedBy, editedAt }

EMAIL OTP
- Use SMTP (Gmail app password) implementation
- Provide setup instructions and env variables:
  SMTP_HOST, SMTP_PORT, SMTP_USER, SMTP_PASS, FROM_EMAIL

RUN INSTRUCTIONS (MUST INCLUDE)
- Step-by-step how to run backend (.NET), frontend (Vite), and MongoDB locally
- Provide Postman collection examples for main endpoints
- Provide sample .env files (frontend + backend) with placeholders
- Include troubleshooting tips (CORS, port issues, JWT errors)

IMPORTANT UI REQUIREMENTS
- Use Bootstrap 5 layout + cards + form floating labels where appropriate
- No window alerts. Use toast notifications.
- Show loading spinners for API calls.
- Clean, classic, professional UI.

OUTPUT FORMAT
- First show folder structure tree.
- Then provide code files with clear filenames and code blocks.
- Don’t skip any critical code: authentication, OTP, upload, protected routes must work.
